# Chisel Sheath

A parametric chisel sheath OpenSCAD model. Comes with cute ears and eyes too!
I always keep my chisels in sheaths when I lay them on the workbench so that they stay protected if I bump something into them or accidentally drop them. 
The sheaths have a tapered fit and sit snug on the chisel blade. Putting on and removing the sheaths is als very satisfying!

If you enjoy my work, please like to show your support!

You can configure these sheaths directly on makerworld

The parameters are documented in the comments.

I think PLA is fine as long as you don't plan on dropping your chisel, but you may as well use PETG or something stronger. 

## Configuring for your chisel

Use a pair of calipers to measure your chisel at the various dimensions listed in the parameter comments. Don't worry too much about accuracy. The fudge room for this is very large. You can/should make the width bevel length longer (+2mm) and/or the thicknesses slightly smaller (-0.1mm) to ensure a good fit.

Be sure to dry your chisels before inserting to avoid rust. Applying oil to your tools is always a good idea! The eye holes can also help avoid moisture buildup.
