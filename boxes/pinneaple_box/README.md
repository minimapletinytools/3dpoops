Stackable "pinneaple" boxes with magnetic lids.

Requires:
6x 6x3 magnets
2x 18x3 magnets 

These *should* press fit in, however due to variable tolerances between printers and materials, you may find that a little super glue is needed sometimes.

For inserting the magnet on the bottom of the "bot" piece, it helps a lotto back the hollow inside with a piece of wood while you smack the magnet in with a rubber mallet.


f3d file is available for customization. They are a little wonky. You can change the nbops starred parameter to resize automatically but that number MUST be between 1-8.
